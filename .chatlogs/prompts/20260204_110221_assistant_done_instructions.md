Done — I added [ .github/copilot-instructions.md ]( .github/copilot-instructions.md ) summarizing the repo state and agent steps. Would you like me to (pick one): run a project discovery search for `*.csproj` now, expand the file with examples specific to your code (if you point me to the `src/` folder), or adjust tone/length of the instructions?
