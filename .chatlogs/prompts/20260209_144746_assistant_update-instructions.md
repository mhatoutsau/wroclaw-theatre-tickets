## Changes Made

Updated instructions to prominently reference the customized backend instructions:

### 1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Added "Important: Backend Instructions" section at the top
- Directs developers to review `backend.instructions.md` before editing `src/**`
- Highlights key convention: single-line `using` statements

### 2. `docs/SESSION_LOGGING.md`
- Added "Backend-Specific Instructions" section
- References the backend instructions file
- Provides link with key conventions

These changes ensure developers are aware of backend-specific coding standards alongside the session logging practices.
