Added an extended root README with project overview, architecture, setup, tests, and documentation links, and updated gitignore to exclude session logs.

Changes:

- README.md (new): project summary, tech stack, setup steps, tests, docs, and logging guidance.
- .gitignore: added .chatlogs/ to keep logs out of version control.
