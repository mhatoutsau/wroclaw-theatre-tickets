Downgraded frontend TypeScript to 5.5.4 to match the supported @typescript-eslint range and updated the lockfile. Re-ran frontend lint; it now passes without the TypeScript warning.

Commands:

- npm install --save-dev typescript@5.5.4 (frontend/)
- npm run lint (frontend/)

Notes:

- npm reported 5 moderate vulnerabilities; no audit fix was run.
